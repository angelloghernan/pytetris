# pytetris

A project made CMU's SAMS program, this is a version of Tetris made using tkinter (for all the graphics) and pygame (for sounds). I expanded beyond the original requirements to make a more enjoyable version of the project.

You can run the project using the python interpreter, as long as pygame is installed (use pip install pygame).
