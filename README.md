# pytetris

A project made CMU's SAMS program, this is a version of Tetris made using tkinter (for all the graphics) and pygame (for sounds). I expanded beyond the original requirements/features to make a more enjoyable version of the project -- you can read about it in the code's header of comments.

You can run the project using the python interpreter, as long as pygame is installed (use pip install pygame).
