# pytetris

A project made for CMU's SAMS program and expanded upon, this is a version of Tetris made using tkinter (for all the graphics) and pygame (for sounds). I expanded beyond the original requirements/features to make a more enjoyable version of the project -- you can read about it in the code's header of comments.

You can run the project using the python interpreter, as long as pygame is installed (use pip install pygame). Also make sure to have the clearSound.wav file in the same directory as the py file. Enjoy!
